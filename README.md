# Roll The Dice

Solidity implementation of [Simple Dice Game](https://www.lancasterschools.org/cms/lib/NY19000266/Centricity/Domain/454/dice%20games.pdf)

> Choose a number and roll the dice. You score a point every time you roll that number. When you
> roll that number, you get another turn. When that number is not rolled, the turn is over. Mark the
> tally for each time you roll the number. First one to a certain score of 10 points wins! (Set the
> point total low for young children and higher for older ages.)
